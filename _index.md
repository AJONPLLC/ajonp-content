## <i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i> Learning

Our feeling is that people learn in multiple ways. Offering both written and visual learning helps aid in the effort.

I know during a boring meeting I tend to read a whole lot better than watching a video.
Or late at night when you are in bed trying not to wake the person lying next to you ;)
