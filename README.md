## AJonP's Goals

### Build a friendly Developer Community

Become a community where you can get questions answered among colleagues and allow for a central place to reference learning tools.
Please feel free to join the AJonP Gitter Community to network with developers, ask questions, and have information directly at your fingertips.

### Learning

Our feeling is that people learn in multiple ways. Offering both written and visual learning helps aid in the effort.
Just remember AJ, he is our real motivation.

## What the cat?
Kinda like Disney said ‚ÄúIt was all started by a mouse.‚Äù
AJonP stands for AJ on Programming, AJ is our üò∫ mascot, so "It was all started by a cat".# ajonp-hugo-amp
