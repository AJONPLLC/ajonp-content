# Better Performance through analysis

The current web standard for initial page load is 2.0 seconds. But this is only part of the performance story. Let's dive in a little deeper and see how else we can improve performance. 
In terms of data reduction and user experience, sometimes these things are not as noticeable.

## Web.dev

[Web.dev learning](https://web.dev/learn) is one of the best sources to increase performance on your site.

As you can see in the video, they have several subjects to help improve your sites performance.

I actually find myself using the [measure](https://web.dev/measure) feature prior to diving into the learning section. But I never was good at "hitting the books" in school, I am a visual hands on learner ðŸ˜º.
