# Front End Web Development Podcasts

I listen to all of my podcasts using [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/), it makes my life easy to switch from mobile over to desktop super easy. I also love the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/pocket-casts/id414834813) app designs. I am not affiliated with Pocket Casts at time of writing this blog. This list is in no particular order (yet).

> Like everything I try to always include the community, so if you have a podcast you want to share please throw me a [pull request](https://github.com/AJONPLLC/ajonp-content/tree/master/blog/frontend-web-development-podcasts.md)!

A podcast featuring panelists of engineers from [@Netflix](https://twitter.com/@Netflix), [@Evernote](https://twitter.com/@Evernote), [@Atlassian](https://twitter.com/@Atlassian) & [@LinkedIn](https://twitter.com/@LinkedIn) talking over drinks about all things Front End development.

### Alex's Thoughts

Front End Happy Hour has become my weekly cast. I enjoy how light the conversation remains, while the technical material is amazingly relevant. Of course it is easy to this when you have some of the top experts in some of the biggest Tech companies as guests üò∫.

## Syntax - Tasty Web

### Pocket Casts Description

Full Stack Developers Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski dive deep into web development topics, explaining how they work and talking about their own experiences. They cover from JavaScript frameworks like React, to the latest advancements in CSS to simplifying web tooling.

### Alex's Thoughts

Syntax is hosted by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/@wesbos) and [Scott Tolinski](https://twitter.com/@stolinski). Both are gifted teachers and have great tutorial based websites [wesbos.com](https://wesbos.com/) and [leveluptutorials.com](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/) respectively. I usually catch up on these while üèÉ.

If JavaScript and/or the web touch your life, this show‚Äôs for you. Some people search for JSParty and can't find the show, so now the string JSParty is in our description too.

### Alex's Thoughts

This really is a party, not in the sense everyone is filling up balloons all the time. It is more of the kind of party where all the Stranger Things get around a table and nerd out for a while! I really enjoy how empowering the episodes make you feel after listening.

### Pocket Casts Description

We're [Emma Wedekind](@EmmaWedekind), [Kelly Vaughn](@kvlly), [Lindsey Kopacz](@LittleKope), and [Ali Spittel](@ASpittel) - four seasoned software developers working in different sectors. Since there's a major lack of technical podcasts out there, we've decided to start one. Just kidding -- there's already a ton! But, we wanted to add our voices to the space and share our diverse experiences and advice. We'll have great discussions around how to start coding, the hot technologies right now, how to get your first developer job, and more!

### Alex's Thoughts

They hosts are absolute rock stars in the [#webdev](https://twitter.com/search?q=webdev) community! They are 9 episodes into the start of this podcast series, I can't wait to listen to more.

### Pocket Casts Description
Developer Tea exists to help driven developers connect to their ultimate purpose and excel at their work so that they can positively impact the people they influence. With over 13 million downloads to date, Developer Tea is a short podcast hosted by [Jonathan Cutrell](https://twitter.com/@jcutrell), co-founder of Spec and developer at [Clearbit](https://twitter.com/@Clearbit). We hope you'll take the topics from this podcast and continue the conversation, either online or in person with your peers.


### Alex's Thoughts

Jonathan's voice is so soothing, you won't be able to stop listening (be careful while driving). This podcast fits great on most commutes as it usually seems to be about 15 minutes or less (a few are longer). This podcast is basically yoga for my ears, it makes me settle down and really appreciate the goals that are constantly rolling around in my mind. As of writing this there are 720 episodes, I don't know how anyone can make that many so quickly, but they are all really well made and though out.

## The Web Platform Podcast

### Alex's Thoughts
The Web Platform Podcast is one of my favorites, it was my weekly listen. They are releasing a little less regularly now, but still great guests and content.

### Pocket Casts Description

AngularAir is a video podcast about the Google Angular platform hosted by Justin Schwartzenberger.

### Alex's Thoughts

Angular Air has a weird way of publishing their podcasts. So I will usually catch theirs on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdCOpvRk1lsBk26ePGDPLpQ), as it tends to be interactive which is awesome!

## Full Stack Radio

### Alex's Thoughts

Full Stack Radio helps remind me as an aspiring front end developer, to remember the backend. I actually stumbled into this one because [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan) is one of the creators of [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and is a great author.

Toolsday pulls you in at the very beginning with Una playing an awesome new ukulele song! Because of [Una Kravets](https://twitter.com/una) and [Chris Dhanaraj](https://twitter.com/chrisdhanaraj)'s amazing UI/Frontend experience working at Google and Netflix.

Adventures in Angular is new for me but after listening to the latest with [Hans Larsen](https://twitter.com/@hanslatwork) and the work on the Angular CLI I am eager to work through the backlog, it is currently episode 252 so it might take me a minute üò∫

Conversations about React with your favorite developers.

### Alex's Thoughts

React Podcast is hosted by [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/@chantastic), in full honesty I haven't listened to a cast yet, but this came up as a suggestion since I am new to the ReactJS community. So it is now in my queue ü§ûto learn a lot!

## ShopTalk

I found Shop Talk Show very recently and have been really enjoying it. [Dave Rupert](https://twitter.com/davatron5000) is a fun guy to listen to and his [site](https://daverupert.com/) is super awesome! If you don't know the name [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier), I am sure you have seen a thing he Co-founded called [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). So lets just say they are really smart guys, that have on really smart

The Google Cloud Platform Podcast, coming to you every week. Discussing everything on Google Cloud Platform from App Engine to Big Query.

### Alex's Thoughts

I am a huge Google Cloud fan so I try to catch up on all of these episodes. I will admit if there is something (like networking) I will often skip, until it is an episode geared more towards development.

## Y Combinator

### Pocket Casts Description

Guy Raz dives into the stories behind some of the world's best known companies. How I Built This weaves a narrative journey about innovators, entrepreneurs and idealists‚Äîand the movements they built.

### Alex's Thoughts

This is probably more for wanting to keep AJonP going üò∫, keeping anything as a side hustle takes work, so it helps to hear others story!
