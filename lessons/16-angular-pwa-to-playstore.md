description: PWA (Progressive Web Apps) are becoming more mainstream, allowing web
  applications to run as if they are native applications on your devices. Something
  that has been missing is the ability to list these applications in a centralized
  developer store. With the new introduction of TWA (Trusted Web Activity) you are
  now allowed to create a native application and APK file from a trusted PWA. Which
  means you can now delivery your PWA directly from the Google Play Store.
